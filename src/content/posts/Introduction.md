# Hello! 
Welcome to my (jaemin han, if you didn't see on the tab, header, or the big things on the side) blog.

```python
print("greetings planet")
```

I'm a Statistics student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence, and
directly and rapidly translating my ideas (bad or good) into code. I hope to write about my marginally interesting ideas and learnings here
and practice technical writing at a level gripping enough to only induce slight levels of drowsiness in my readers.

Thanks for reading!
