**Codecracker** is a codenames solver that uses word embeddings to find the closest word vectors to a set of words to provide
clue words for a codemaster. It's a... little janky, but future improvements using more sophisticated approaches are planned!

The **Black Friday Sentiment** project is a project that aimed to analyze general sentiment around black friday using tweets! I learnt a lot about Apache Spark, and working with big data overall! The tweet dataset I worked with had 1 million+ rows overall, and it was a lot of fun learning how to use Databricks clusters and Spark to parallelize operations. It used **AWS Athena** and **QuickSight** to pull from a S3 bucket and create a dashboard.

The **Uber Ridership Visualization** is a project I used to get familiar and learn about **Tableau**. It uses public Uber ridership data to visualize ridership patterns in the New York City area as I try to find patterns of how people take uber rides in different weather conditions and times of week/day!
