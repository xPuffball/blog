# About
Welcome to my website! 

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari).

Hi there! I'm **Jaemin**.

I have a Statistics and Computing degree at the University of Waterloo, and have previously worked as both a Full Stack Developer and a Machine Learning Engineer.

As a developer, I enjoy working across the full stack and exploring how we can use AI to solve real problems. I'm particularly interested in natural language interfaces and making technology more intuitive for everyone. Outside of coding, I host a data science podcast where I chat with industry experts about their work and experiences, as well as spending unhealthy amounts of time and money at hot pot and escape rooms. I maintain a 100% winrate on every escape room I've done so far, and the day that streak breaks is the day I fall into unimaginable despair.

I write about random things I find interesting, which is sometimes related to AI, machine learning, and data science, but never about the secret AI cartel that may or may not run this website.

(feel free to shoot me a message on anything!)
